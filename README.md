## Description

Those are some exercises I am doing to study developing games. I'm learning from an udemy course and a book about Phaser and HTML5 to create these games and by coding live in class. Each state is like a minigame or low-end games that are classics and I mostly studied how to apply basic mechanics and how to use the game engine itself because I am competent enough with javascript for now.
